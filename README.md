# Sleep-in Assignment  

## Problem Description
The parameter weekday is True if it is a weekday, and the parameter vacation is True if we are on vacation. 
You get to sleep in if it is not a weekday or if you're on vacation. Print `Yes` if you sleep in and `No` if you don't.

## Example
```
Weekend? True
Vacation? True
Sleep In: Yes
```

## Suggested Approach
Check the values of weekday and vacation and return the appropriate response. Map out all combinations before you begin!
* Watch the formatting - capitalization, etc.
* If you're worried about the user typing the response with a capital letter, remind them in the prompt. You can also use the `.title()` method to correct it. Ask if you want to try it!

### Submitting your Repo

* Go to the repo on GitHub and click on the Pull Requests tab. Look for feedback about code function and style. If any issues are found, fix them and check your changes in to GitHub. repeat until no errors are found.
* When done, submit "Done" on Canvas.
